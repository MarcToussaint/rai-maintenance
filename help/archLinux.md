## Install on Arch

What to do to install MLR on Arch Linux?

First install all dependencies. You need some things from AUR, so first install
yaourt or something similar to handle AUR packages.

    $ yaourt -S opencv plib ann lapack blas qhull

In order to get a working cblas library we need atlas-lapack, but be warned.
This literally will take hours of compile time (something like 5-10 h depending
on your system).

    $ yaourt -S atlas-lapack

(You can either drink a lot of coffee in the meantime or put LAPACK = 0 in your
gofMake/config.mk until it is finished...)

MLR needs a .so-file called libANN, ann provides one, but names it libann so we
link it:

    $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libANN.so /usr/lib/libann.so
    $ sudo ldconfig

qhull is newer in arch than in ubuntu and changes some pointer/reference things.
You need to put 

   ARCH_LINUX = 1

in your gofMake/config.mk. This fixes the qhull change.

Everything else is equal to ubuntu.
